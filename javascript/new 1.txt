	<p> This is the story of the magical book. It was that time again. The time where schools would close for a short period of time, it was School Holidays. Every School Holiday my parents would ask me that which I desired to do for the holidays. That time I desired to see a magical show, I have always enjoyed magic. I then told my parents what I desired for the holidays, but to my surprise they told me they had a better proposal for me. They gave me a book, the magical book. The book consisted of many short stories. The magic to the book was that each story that I would read would come to life. I would then read the book each time I wanted to go on a magical journey, and that is the story of the magical book. </p>
